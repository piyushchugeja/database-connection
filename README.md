In order to work with databases using PHP, you need to establish a connection with your database first.
This is a simple code which heps you do that.
All you need to do so is:
- Name of your database <code>$databasename</code>
- Name of your server <code>$servername</code>
- Username which you use to access your database <code>$username</code>
- Password (if applicable) which you use to access your database <code>$password</code>
  - Passwords are usually mandatory while dealing with a database hosted online using hosting providers
- The next step is to add all these in the code at proper places and run it, you are connected to the database
